            What would I do without your smart mouth? <br>
            Drawing me in and you kicking me out <br>
            Got my head spinning, no kidding <br>
            I can't pin you down
        </p>
        <p>
            What's going on in that beautiful mind? <br>
            I'm on your magical mystery ride <br>
            And I'm so dizzy, don't know what hit me <br>
            But I'll be alright

            My head's under water <br>
            But I'm breathing fine <br>
            You're crazy and I'm out of my mind
        </p>
        <p>
            Cause all of me <br>
            Loves all of you <br>
            Love your curves and all your edges <br>
            All your perfect imperfections
        </p>
        <p>
            Give your all to me <br>
            I'll give my all to you <br>
            You're my end and my beginning <br>
            Even when I lose, I'm winning <br>
            Cause I give you all of me <br>
            And you give me all of you, oh-oh
        </p>

            How many times do I have to tell you? <br>
            Even when you're crying, you're beautiful too <br>
            The world is beating you down, I'm around through every mood <br>
            You're my downfall, you're my muse <br>
            My worst distraction, my rhythm and blues <br>
            I can't stop singing, it's ringing <br>
            In my head for you
        </p>
        <p>
            My head's under water <br>
            But I'm breathing fine <br>
            You're crazy and I'm out of my mind <br>
            Cards on the table <br>
            We're both showing hearts <br>
            Risking it all, though it's hard
